<body>

<p>The app &quot;Alexander-von-Humboldt-Plan&quot;, hereby
abbreviated to AvH Plan, is provided as a free service by the developer for use
as is.<br>
<br>
This page is used to inform visitors and users regarding policies with the
collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, if they choose to make
use of the service.<br>
<br>
AvH Plan does not collect, store, share, or in any other way use personal
information retrieved from its users. Any information asked for within the app
is only used to improve the user experience and as such, is stored locally and
cannot be accessed by third-parties or be used to identify the user.<br>
<br>
Information Collection and Use<br>
<br>
At this moment, AvH Plan does not require personally identifiable information
for its core functionality. Certain features do require entering information
that may be personally identifiable, however, this data will be retained on the
user's device and is therefore not accessible outside the app<br>
<br>
Log Data<br>
<br>
In the case of an error in the app, device-specific data may be collected and
stored on your phone. This data is called Log Data. This Log Data may include
information, such as your device's Internet Protocol ('IP') address, device
name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilising the
service, the time and date when the last usage occured, and other statistics.
This data can not be used to personally identify any user.<br>
<br>
Cookies<br>
<br>
Cookies are files with small amounts of data that are commonly used as
anonymous unique identifiers on the web. AvH Plan strives to not make use of
cookies for its functionality, however, as its functionality requires access to
third-party-websites, cookies may be unintentionally collected by the device's
web browser. AvH Plan does not make use of these cookies in any way.<br>
<br>
Service Providers<br>
<br>
No third-parties are employed for providing any functionality or services of
the AvH Plan-app and as such, all functionality is accessible without directly
sharing personal data with third-parties.<br>
<br>
Security<br>
<br>
While absolute security cannot be ensured due to the internet functionality the
app employs, no information is shared over any transmission methods.<br>
<br>
Links to Other Sites<br>
<br>
This Service may contain links to other sites, which are not operated by the
developer of AvH Plan. The user is advised to review the privacy policy of any
webpage they may access through the app. No responsibility for the content of
these third-party websites is provided by the app developer.<br>
<br>
Children's Privacy<br>
<br>
The service does not address anyone under the age of 13. As the app does not
collect any information from its users, no data is collected from users that
may be under the age of 13.<br>
<br>
Changes to This Privacy Policy<br>
<br>
This privacy policy may be updated as the AvH Plan app is updated with new
features. As such, the user is advised to review this page periodically for any
changes. Any changes that may be made are effective immediately upon
publishing.<br>
